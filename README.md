# Hottest_Topics_in_Machine_Learning
In this project I will use Natural Language Processing on NIPS papers to discover the hottest topics in machine learning.

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. I will analyze a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. The techniques used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well.
